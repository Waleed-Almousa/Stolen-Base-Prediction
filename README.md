Repo consists of a maching learning model built using SciKit-Learn in order to predict whether or not a stolen base attempt will be successful

The final model is a random forest classifier that is able to predict the success of a stolen base attempt with **88% accuracy** and **97% precision**

Precision is most important in this context as it indicates that 97% of the time that the model predicts that a stolen base attempt will be successful, it will be correct. This model can be used to minimize the risk taken by MLB coaches and dramatically increase their team's stolen base attempt success rate.
