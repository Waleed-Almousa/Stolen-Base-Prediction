Repo consists of a python model built using SciKit-Learn in order to predict the whether or not a stolen base attempt will be successful

**MLB Stolen Base Predictions.pdf**: Powerpoint presentation of analasys and results

 **Project-Report.pdf**: Project report

**stolen_base_features.csv** : The final data set used to train and test the model; all data comes from MLB statistics

**main.ipynb**: The code and model we built in order to predict stolen base

Findings show we can predict the success of a stolen base attempt given the features used with 88% accuracy and 97% precision

Precision is most important in this context as it indicates that 97% of the time that the model predicts a successfull stolen base attempt, it will be correct. This model can be used to minimize the risk taken by MLB coaches and increase their team's stolen base attempt successrate to 97%.
