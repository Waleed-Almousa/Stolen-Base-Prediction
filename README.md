Repo consists of a python model built using SciKit-Learn in order to predict stolen base successes. 


stolen_base_features.csv is the final data gathered across multiple sources for analysis

main.ipynb consists of the code and model we built in order to predict stolen bases

MLB Stolen Base Predictions.pdf is the powerpoint made presenting our analysis and results


Findings show we can predict a stolen base given the features used to 88% accuracy but more importantly, 97% precision

Precision was most important in this case as it suggests that 97% of the time we predict a stolen base, it will be correct.
